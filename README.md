Step 2. Open the application's directory in a terminal or command line.
Step 3. To install requirements, run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

Step 1. Edit `config.ini` as you need to.
Step 2. Run by the command `python path\to\project\directory\main.py` for `windows`,
        and `python3 path\to\project\directory\main.py` for `Linux` or `MacOs`.

Then you can use the module just like in the `test.py` example file.
